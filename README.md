# Amma's Pickles 🍲

A fully responsive website developed as part of a **freelancing project** for a local homemade pickle business – *Amma’s Pickles*. The platform enables the business to manage their pickle listings, take online orders, and collect customer feedback.

This project combines a clean frontend, real-time backend integration using Firebase, and user/owner login systems to support both business growth and customer experience.
